# popcorn: A toy microkernel x64 UEFI OS 

**popcorn** is a hobby OS for x64 UEFI environments to play with building a
microkenerl architecture. It's far from finished, or even being usable - for
now, it's a sandbox for me to explore the UEFI architecture, microkernels, and
OS-related concepts that I want to play with.
